    [B]: 'As you may already assume, school is reserved for the wealthy Lords and Ladies; Kings and Queens. Of course, a select few of us rich millers and Lords can go to school, and I have even heard rumors that you can learn to read or write!',
    [I]: 'Children have almost no time for leisure: and definitely no time for pleasure. We can not go to school, as we must waste our days with pigs and chickens. School is expensive, and almost no one can learn to read or write. Of course, Middle Class and Upper Class folk always push their smarts in our faces... (Grrrrr!)',
    [S]: 'Yes, Yes, Yes! I truly LOVE school! We learn to read, write, and pray. Being taught by Popes and Priests, of course we are educated and well-brought up. Only the wealthiest of the wealthy can get an education- I am lucky my father was chosen by god to become royalty!',

    [S]: 'You stopped being a child when you were responsible for your own actions: at the age of 12. There was only a 40% chance of death in the first year of childhood, us with our good doctors and all.',

    [B]: 'Usually we will eat whatever our jobs provide. If you are a miller, for instance, you may eat mostly bread. If you are a Lord or Lady, you will eat mostly meats and goods from the peasants harvests.',
    [I]: 'Our meals mainly consist of porridge, a mixture of leftovers. If we are lucky, though, we may be able to eat meats! But with our hands, of course, because lower classes do not have the privilege of utensils.',
    [S]: 'Our meals are splendid! We eat rich meats, fish, bread- anything and everything our servants can supply! Us upper-class people can also use utensils, so that is all more the better!',
